# Social Media Engagement Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing social media engagement data to uncover insights into factors influencing user interactions. Using various statistical and machine learning techniques, we explore correlations, visualize key trends, and build predictive models.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains metrics related to social media campaigns, including:
- **Follower Count**: The number of followers on a given platform.
- **Posts Per Week**: Frequency of content posting.
- **Engagement Rate**: User interaction percentage.
- **Ad Spend (USD)**: Budget allocated for advertising.
- **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of users who completed a desired action.
- **Campaign Reach**: Total audience reached by a campaign.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Correlation Analysis
- We calculate correlations between numeric features and visualize them using a heatmap.
- High correlations are identified to understand relationships between key metrics.

### Data Visualizations
- Scatter plots and bar charts analyze engagement rates, ad spend, and conversion rates.
- Platform-based comparisons highlight performance differences.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
### Regression Analysis
- A **Linear Regression** model predicts the **Conversion Rate** based on **Ad Spend**.
- Regression lines are visualized per platform.

### Decision Tree Regressor
- A **Decision Tree Regressor** is trained to predict **Ad Spend** using **Campaign Reach**.
- Performance is evaluated using R², MSE, and RMSE.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
